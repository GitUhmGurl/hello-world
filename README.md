# hello-world
New to the technological aspect of data science, and eager to learn! My strengths include sorting, compartmentalizing, organizing, etc., in hopes of gaining more. 
I enjoy long walks on the beach...lol, and making others laugh. I enjoy the beauty that's in the world, and I always try to find the good in everything.
