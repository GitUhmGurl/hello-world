# hello-world
New to the technological aspect of data science, and eager to learn! My strengths include sorting, compartmentalizing, organizing, etc., in hopes of gaining more insights in the field. 
I enjoy taking long walks on the beach...lol! And making others laugh. I love discovering the beauty that's in the world each day, and I always try to find the good in everything.
